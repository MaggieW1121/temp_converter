# temp_converter

There's no instruction around how to use this digital outcome, as all the guides are including in the digital outcome.

Please do make any command if this digital outcome makes you feel confusing
(as this would lead to the usability issues around the instructions in the digital outcome)

In this version, the functions including:
1. Main GUI - Converter GUI (conversions around "To Centigrade" & "To Fahrenheit")
2. Help GUI - with some brief instruction (it is unnecessary to reading that)
3. History GUI - Display recent 7 past history
4. Export GUI - Export the past calculations (as is shown in the History GUI)

This is only a temporary version of my digital outcome, there are some functions that I would add afterwards:
1. export GUI: in the final version, I will set up a default filename 
(the filename would be the current time)
2. history GUI: in the final version, I will set up scrollbar including all the history so far
3. history GUI: in the final version, base on the calculation history, the users are able to choose specific conversion history
and turn the data into a trend graph

Possible function (TBC)
1. I might change the help GUI into an instruction GUI at the beginning and ask the user to read through the instruction
before use this digital outcome. 
(with this trend graph, I might add some commands around the temperature converted, i.e. cold/hot......)
2. I might add a function that allow the users to select specific calculation history and export that in a file
